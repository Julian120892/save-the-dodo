# save-the-dodo
An online petition that visitors can sign to make their voice heard.

## About the Project
Dodos were once the largest land birds that existed. It must be possible to bring them back with a little science fiction magic. It worked for Jurassic Park, after all. 
This petition lets users sign for this very purpose and shows the signers who else has signed besides them.
